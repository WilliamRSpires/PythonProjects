# PythonProjects

A collection of projects that I completed when I first started learning Python. If you're considering learning Python, I highly recommend taking the Python bootcamp course from Jose Portilla on Udemy.

String Reversal takes in a string and reverses it. 

FizzBuzz is a simple coding exercise that iterates over a list of numbers and prints Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz depending on whether the number is divisible by 5,3, or both. 

PalindromeCheck takes in a string and tells the user if the string is a Palindrome. 

I original posted these to GitHub as IPython notebooks, but I'm going to convert them to .py files and post them here. 

Please feel free to use these projects and if you find them helpful don't hesitate to let me know. Feel free to check out my website williamrspires.com and look at my other projects on GitHub.
